{"review": "Released in 1986, Aki Kaurismaki's Varjoja paratiisissa (Shadows in Paradise) is one of the Finnish filmmaker's earliest efforts, and it stands as one of the most idiosyncratic romantic comedies of all time. The painfully shy Nikander (Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4), a garbage man, means the moody Ilona, a supermarket checkout girl. The film tracks their bumbling attempt to establish a lasting relationship: dates that end as soon as they've begun, a romantic getaway where they each retreat to separate hotel rooms, and rare conversations which employ the absolute bare minimum of words. Nikander's best", "rating": "70"}

The script begins with the sudden marriage of Mortimer Brewster, a famous theater critic known for being a bachelor. When preparing his bags for his honeymoon trip, the young man discovers that the tw", "rating": "100"}

She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to ringleader Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio. This part of the duology is more dialogue-", "rating": "70"}

The Bride (Uma Thurman) is continuing her quest to avenge herself on the killer of her fianc\u00e9e and unborn child, but unlike with the first outing we do not face more endless ensemble fight scenes. This is much more focussed and individual. Her encounter with Sidewinder (Michael Madsen) tests her mettle - and her panic control in a frighteningly claustrophobic manner - before the eyepatch sporting Daryl Hannah (Elle) offers probably her finest on-screen performance as together they manage to demolish a motor home using samurai swords and their body w", "rating": "70"}

Three homicidal maniacs who are called good, bad, and ugly, but really they're all just bad and ugly. Eli Wallach steals the show. I think most people agree with me on that, and for some people he saves the show, but I need better writing, and more credible characters in incredible circumstances than we get with Leone.

I'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. S\u00e9rgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces. This is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work.", "rating": "100"}

You can immediately recognise this film has Sir Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s signature on it from the way the film is shot and its story is told.

It might have been better to have written Tony as a chess master than a former tennis star. It would have been a bit more in keeping with his plots and strategies.

No other director today digs so profoundly into the human soul, or in such a creative way. And no other director has been so daring with visual translation. On this watching of Dogville, it finally hit me that this story is the life story of a woman in an abusive relationship. Maybe inspired in part by Polly's Seer\u00e4uberjenny from Threepenny Opera, or not.

It's a solid Bond flick, but rarely cited when the best films of the franchise are discussed. The problem isn't Dalton because he makes a fine James Bond and was what the series needed in 1987 (when the film was released). Although the Roger Moore era (1973-1985) is my favorite stretch of the franchise, mainly because they're so all-around entertaining, Roger was just too old in 1987 to continue in the role (he was 60 years-old). Plus", "rating": "60"}
{"review": "Great entry into the series and wonderful debut for Dalton who was charming, and for me far and away better than any of Roger Moore's movies (though found some of his to be entertaining enough). Not all that fond of this theme song but still catchy enough I suppose. Also features some great aerial stuntwork. 3.75/5", "rating": "80"}
{"review": "So Roger Moore has handed the baton of Ian Fleming's 007 to Timothy Dalton and this first outing is not at all bad. The story is, perhaps, not the best but this is still an action packed adventure with loads of pyrotechnics and daft gadgets that really does move along swiftly for over two hours. Bond is assigned to aid would-be defector Gen. Koskov (Jeroen Krabb\u00e9) from Berlin, along the way encountering the lethal cellist Kara (Maryam d'Abo). A bit of fun with the no-nonsense Julie T. Wallace, a Harrier jump jet and and soon-to-be-trashed English stately home set a scene for the ensuing", "rating": "70"}
{"review": "I don't understand all the hate on Dalton as 007, I actually thought he was a decent Bond, I thought he brought back some of the cold blooded assassin that personified the first of the Connery Era films. And I think he was a much needed change of pace away from Moore's silliness. However, I think some of the hate comes from the change of pace away from the silliness. You get used to things and a lot of people got used to Moore. But, then again, I was 7 when The Living Daylights came out, this was the first 007 movie I REMEMBER seeing in the theaters, and there is that special place in", "rating": "100"}
{"review": "The last of the very good 007 films. The last of the fun 007 films for sure. Here, Bond is supposed to stop an assassination of a Russian VIP defecting to the West, but Bond senses something, and instead of killing the assassin (a shapely female violinist), he shoots the weapon from her hand. Something is amiss about the defector, and it's obvious to the viewer, though perhaps not obvious to someone who is in the story. We get lots of great scenery, lots of action, lots of wit, and some great horse play, such as riding a violin case like a sled to escape bad guys. It's perhaps the most fu", "rating": "80"}

{"review": "Effective immediately, your licence to kill is revoked, and I require you to hand over your weapon. Licence to Kill is directed by John Glen and written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G.

{"review": "A different kind of Bond Released in 1989, Licence to Kill always struck me as the most atypical Bond film. In this one James (Timothy Dalton) goes rogue after a good friend's bride is murdered and the friend is half-eaten by a shark. Stripped of his authority, Bond vengefully goes after the responsible drug lord, Sanchez (Robert Davi). The opening act drives home that Licence to Kill is a more serious and brutal Bond flick. Although there's still a lot of yeah, right moments, the comedic edge of past Bond films is all but gone. And the violence is so savage and merciless comp", "rating": "60"}
{"review": "I was just not a fan of Timothy Dalton's 007 and so can't say I was looking forward with much enthusiasm to this. Sadly, it didn't surprise - it's a really far fetched, frankly rather unpleasant, outing for Ian Fleming's deadly agent that sees him on the trail of an evil drug lord who fed Felix (David Hedison) to a shark whilst doing away that man's new wife. What now ensues is just a series of unremarkable set-piece escapades that have precious little jeopardy to them.

{"review": "Man, del Toro was only 21 in this film and still makes a showing as one of the most lethal Bond baddies in the history of the franchise. And for those of you who are obsessed with Bondlore, this is the 007 film that references the events in OHMSS which proves that Bond is one person and not just a title like the people who are trying to completely rewrite the franchise to inject modern politics over story and fun.

{"review": "License to Kill transformers Bond from a goofy punchline to a vengeful unstoppable force, turning the franchise from whimsical to gritty and producing one of the best films of the series. License to Kill marked a major shift in the franchise away from the campy, goofy, and almost family-friendly Roger Moore Bind films to something darker and more brutal. Timothy Dalton\u2019s Bond is savage and emotional, using only his wits to track down an elusive drug lord and devising an elaborate scheme to exact revenge and cripple the entire drug enterprise. No longer are the jokes and gadgets the focus", "rating": "80"}
{"review": "This 007 film stays true to its motif. This begins an era of no fun 007 films, where the wit is very minimal and every scene is whiplash brutal. However, unlike most later 007 films, this one stays true to its design. It doesn't try to contrive the story. Instead, there is a flow. One interesting aspect is that we see something worse than death, as is pointed out earlier, with David Hedison getting brutal treatment in his recurring Felix role. We see the beginning of an era where evil is in charge of the world. No longer is there anyone to be trusted outside of a few men like James an", "rating": "70"}

{"review": "Goldeneye is the gold standard of spy movies and Bond films. Goldeneye edges out Casino Royale and Skyfall as my favorite Bond film of all time. After decades of campy James Bond movies like Octopussy and A View to a Kill, Bond felt more like a punchline than a suave master spy.

And I remember that the media kept asking who will be 007's villain now that the USSR has fallen? By then I had seen all the Bond films to date, by then I was a 007 fanatic, and that is when I first realized that the media really has the memory of a Goldfish... a lesson that would serve me well later in life and still does to this day.

{"review": "This 007 movie begins with Bond and a fellow agent performing heroics, and the other agent is killed. However, even when this movie was made, it is quite obvious that the other agent wasn't killed, and that he is actually the villain. That isn't even a spoiler. Bond deals with Russians mostly here. Not surprisingly, any good Russian becomes a dead Russian with the immortal godlike villain at work. One saving grace is a bit of dark humor with a computer nerd at the end. That's about it. Otherwise, it's just another depressing Hollywood formula movie, the usual darkest before the Dawn that", "rating": "20"}

The plot is obvious and speaks for itself, it does lead to a few interesting shenanigans. Some of the dialogue is iffy, as is some of the editing though. None of the cast behind Grant stood out to me, with the exception of Rowan Atkinson; but that's only down to how well known he is in general, as here he is underused.

Tomorrow Never Dies sounded like the jazzy intro to a Connery Era 007 didn't it? It was probably the best Bond song since The Spy Who Loved Me.

The problem is that she ends up, inadvertently, at the home of an American news journalist in charge of interviewing her, and who wants to take advantage of the situation.

It is a visually stunning film and it makes extremely good use of some exceptional locations and interiors and the excruciatingly uncomfortable looking and cumbersome costumes are exquisitely authentic. Of course there are many people out there who will automatically shy away upon learning this is a period film and for good reason. Such films can by their very nature often be obscure and lack any meaning in the modern age. They are slow moving with arcane and unengaging dialogue and the t", "rating": "100"}

With that in mind the film could quite easily be classed as a bit clunky due to the now almost Neanderthal toys, games and computers used in the movie, but casting aside the nostalgia feelings I had with it, it still hits the spot as both a poignant piece of interest, and a damn good thriller as well.

The main issue is that it isn't historical based (and who knows the history to the full extend?), but it was based on a Roward Fast novel of 1951 with lots of romanticized and non historical events. Some things are history: like the basis of the dispute of the senate member involved in the rebellion, like Crassus (the main opositor), Grassus (the roman senator that was more a patrician than a warrior) and young Julius Cesar", "rating": "70"}

That went on for a long time: whenever I saw this film, I ended up not understanding it. That ended today, when I saw it with a friend of mine, who also likes cinema and who told me _\u201cyou have to keep two things in mind: the first is the non-linear narrative, sometimes with very subtle changes; the second is that most of the film is not real life, it is a dream of", "rating": "100"}

I'd ask what is it really about, but I am not sure I'd believe anyone who actually claimed to know. Is it really about anything tangible at all or is Lynch daring the audience to admit that they are too dense to grasp the creative concept here?

{"review": "Holly Martens (Joseph Cotten) receives a job offer from his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in postwar occupied Vienna. He arrives there only to find that Lime is dead and every witness has a different story. Being a pulp writer, Holly thinks he can solve the mystery. But this is a Graham Greene story, and the mystery is not just a whodunit but an exploration of evil. Tangling with a nihilistic band of black marketers exploiting the corruption and ruin of a great city after the war, Holly is told that he is in way over his head. The movie has many unusual touches.

It's one of those films that you can't miss: it has an excellent story, complex characters, a lot of suspense and a good dose of humor, very elegant, almost intertwined with the main story, where we have a young American writer trying to unravel the very poorly explained death. from a friend in the half-ruined city that was Vienna in the years after World War II.

It didn't exist, and so the end result was of an expanded universe of unknown circumstances - except for the brief introduction we got in the opening credits - where the events barely told the story during the time it was running.

{"review": "Truth, if it were needed, that Lesley Manville can turn her hand to anything, but otherwise this is a rather unremarkable biopic of a woman whose character, I must confess, I didn't actually like very much. She is the nan of Amy (Marisa Abela) and the two have a special bond. Amy lives with her mum who is divorced from her dad Mitch (Eddie Marsan). He fancies himself as a bit of a crooner and she is steeped in jazz, determined to write her own songs and make a success of herself - on her own terms. Enter Nick (Sam Buchanan) who works for music mogul Simon Fuller and she is, after an initial bit", "rating": "60"}
{"review": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/back-to-black-movie-review-a-shallow-and-insulting-portrayal-of-amy-winehouse/ Back to Black completely fails in adapting Amy Winehouse\u2019s life to the big screen, falling into common biopic traps, and drowning in them. The film not only disrespectfully omits and revises critical facts from the artist\u2019s life but also fails to convey the emotional depth of her music and the challenges she faced. By turning her story into a superficial, cheap version, not even Marisa Abela\u2019s remarkable performance can save the horrendous work of Sam", "rating": "20"}
{"review": "'Back to Black' is not the best. The opening chunk of the movie, say the first 30-45 minutes, is not good, a very rocky beginning. The introduction to the characters felt unnatural, the spontaneous moments of the lead character (who they make a tiny bit unlikeable at around that point) singing... borderline cringe. I will say, though, from after that the film does improve, funnily enough once the titular track plays I enjoyed this more. Now for the cast. Marisa Abela is, acting-wise, decent enough, I'm not sold on her likeness to Amy Winehouse but I only really know of the musici", "rating": "60"}

I can quote one that I saw recently, and that I remembered while watching this film: \u201cThe Children\u2019s Hour\u201d. Alright, the movie is about a hypothetical lesbian relationship between teachers, it's a different kind of scandal than what we have in this movi", "rating": "90"}

{"review": "I am one of those people that normally hate Will Ferrell, especially in a leading role. I find him obnoxious, and over-the-top to the point where he is pandering for laughs form the LCD than actually attempting to be funny. However, there is always an exception to the rule. Usually that exception comes in the form of a supporting role... as in Old School... but here it comes in the form of a leading role. It seems like Marc Forster really reigned him in on the one and the pay off was AMAZING. It's seriously a funny and quirky film. It's hysterical and kind of plays to an audience that won", "rating": "100"}

The first hour of this is boring, once the (admittedly good) turn comes it does slightly improve. If you take out the main parts of this, you'll hold some good stuff - the message, the twist, the means are just some of them. Sadly, everything that surrounds the positive things set it back.

{"review": "300, the 2007 story of the three hundred Spartans who held off a massive Persian offensive in Ancient Greece, proved a disappointing film. In spite of my Classics degree, I won't complain about the divergences from recorded fact. The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. Rather, what irked me was the hammy dialogue. There were the tropes of recent Hollywood battle scenes: warriors on the good guys' side defending themselves with little exertion as they trade silly quips about how they've got each other's backs.

So with the 4K being released, decided enough time had passed to give it another shot and... it was okay, a bit too stylized for my taste (and yes I know that's Snyder's thing) and lacks the emotional impact Snyder was going for, but there are some bad ass moments, including just Gerard Butler's overall performance, but didn't really do much for me otherwise. Probably my least favorite of Snyder's movies, though haven't watched Sucker Punch in a long time. 3", "rating": "60"}

One of the best parts occurs early as the crew gets to witness the tiny planet Mercury passing between them and the Sun.

{"review": "More style than content. This was my first contact with the cinematographic work of Andrei Tarkovsky, a Soviet filmmaker who would end his career outside his native country when he fell into disgrace for allegedly spending too much money on films that were not worthy of the expense. A regrettable attitude, but typical of countries that prefer to spend money on missiles than on support for culture and education, especially after considering how dangerous and insubmissive can be a cultured population capable of thinking without anyone from a party saying what It's the right thing.

{"review": "Welles/Heston B&W cult noir is great on a technical level, but meh as a viewing experience On the Texas border a Mexican detective (Charlton Heston) assists an American investigation into a shocking murder of an American official on the border, but he soon learns that the imposing & slovenly Sheriff (Orson Welles) is shady with a penchant for framing. Janet Leigh is on hand as the detective\u2019s new bride, an American. \u201cTouch of Evil\u201d (1958) was written/directed by Welles (loosely based on a book) and has a huge reputation as a B&W noir-ish cult flick.

Quinlan (Orson Welles) decides to make a bit of a cursory investigation - in cahoots with his opposite number Vargas (Charlton Heston). Whilst they are out doing their sleuthing, Susan Vargas (Janet Leigh) is lured to a meeting with Uncle Joe (Akim Tamiroff) where it becomes clear that her husband is on the prosecuting side of a family dispute that is putting everyone in danger - something her husband finds out shortly afterwards", "rating": "70"}

And really, he is responsible for great films and was an excellent artist, who understood cinema like few others did. However, in this film, his work was absolutely trampled on by stupid studio managers, and the result of this is that it was only very re", "rating": "80"}

Michael Caine stars as Jack Carter, a tough no nonsense operator in the London underworld who returns to his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne when his brother turns up dead. Directed and adapted to screenplay by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' novel Jack's Return Home, Get Carter is a bleakly atmospheric masterwork that takes the period setting of the time and blends harsh realism with film noir sensibilities and filters it through an uncut prism of", "rating": "100"}
{"review": "Michael Caine is Jack Carter - a gangster who heads from London to Newcastle in England's north east to bury his brother Frank. On the face of it, he was killed in a car accident after taking a dram or two too many. Thing is, though, Carter knows that his brother was no whisky drinker - and so smells a rat. Soon he is embroiled again in the local gangland antics in which he grew up, and on the trail of the truth and the perpetrators. To be honest, I don't think this is Caine's finest work - he is distinctly wooden for much of it; even when naked pointing a shotgun at two men (George Sewel", "rating": "60"}

I just about, marginally, liked the 1963 film, whereas I actually did comfortably enjoy 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey'.

The premise is changed up in some areas, there's a scene that proceeds the conclusion which is rather nice and isn't in the other. The whole feel of this is more engaging, helped by the fact that it gives the animals a voice whi", "rating": "70"}

{"review": "Undervalued thriller. A lone gunman has his sights set on a sell-out crowd at a championship football game. Captain Peter Holly leads the desperate fight to try and stop the maniac from picking people off at will. Perched high on top of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the gunman has his pick of the targets, the Mayor -the President - or merely the innocent? Either way he has to be stopped before all hell breaks loose. Much like Rollercoaster a year later, Two-Minute Warning is wrongly lumped in with the disaster movie genre that flooded the 1970s, and just like Rollercoaster, Two-Min", "rating": "80"}

{"review": "One Missed Call is a remake of the Japanese version from 2003, was directed by Eric Valette and stars Shannyn Sossamon in the leading role. The plot was as simple back then as it is here and now. People receive a call from their own future self to their own cell containing the last few seconds of their deaths. The only problem with this remake is, that the film makers had no idea what they were doing and in my opinion the material of original director Takashi Miike was pretty much raped and left for dead. Not only that this remake doesn't have the creepy feeling of the original Chakushin", "rating": "50"}

It's a raging B schlocker, but a fun one. Filmed in CineMagic in New Eastman Color 5250 no less!

Luckily, the other Iris(h) (Nora Hayden) seems to be conscious and from her hospital bed regales us with the details of their trip to the (very) red planet which, contrary to popular opinion, is not barren at all - but populated with distant cousins of the Venus fly trap and the giant ant! Their explorations start off innocently enough, but soon they start to sense that the planet is becoming a bit hostile. Time to head home, if they still can. The dial", "rating": "50"}
{"review": "Pretty hysterical story of two surviving astronauts returning to Earth, and one recounting their adventures on Mars. To call this film sexist would be an understatement, the science and technology onboard the spacecraft is hilarious- yes, that is a manual typewriter, but the film's one saving grace is the bizarre special camera effect of the surface of the red planet.

{"review": "No Country for Old Men (2007) Another great one from the Coen Brothers 27 January 2009 - 3 out of 3 users found this review helpful. INSTANT CLASSIC.: YES, this film is as good as the critics say. YES, the performances are as good as the Academy says. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is one of my favorite films and I have watched it many, many times. Javier Bardem, makes an excellent screen villain, this guy is really scary, you would not want him chasing you. Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones turn in Solid Performances, and Woody Harrelson also. I'm saving my praise for KELLY MACDONALD, one of my favo", "rating": "100"}

{"review": "I always figured when I got older, God would sorta come inta my life somehow. And he didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I would have the same opinion of me that he does. No Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and the Coen's adapt the screenplay from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harelson, Javier Bardem and Kelly Macdonald. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins.

{"review": "I watched this for the first time with a few friends as part of an ongoing movie night we shared. I think it was the most violent film we watched together. The plot is taut and somewhat riveting, with great dialogue and acting. At the same time, for me, it seemed rather bleak. I gradually had the sense it would not end well for nearly anybody. If it weren\u2019t for the Tommy Lee Jones character, I am not sure I would have wanted to stick with it. He provides a sort of balance in the mood of the film. I am not a big fan of movies with super criminals. You know the ones \u2014 they seem to always be one", "rating": "60"}

I'm all for films that don't play it so straight that it's predictable, but at the same time I'm rarely a fan of films that are so full of themselves to end in such a derisory way. Listen, that's probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt, but 'No Country for Old Men' is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for me. I will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever, they are all fantastic. Javier Bardem is awesome, easily the star, and Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Wood", "rating": "70"}

Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh stands out immediately as a new iconic film villain full of foreboding relentless focus and cold uncaring presence. No Country is clearly a product of the Coen Brothers' unique charm and style. It boasts some tense shoot-outs, and the uncompromising pursuit of Josh Brolin's character was fantastic. Unfortunately, it drags along in some places but by design. The ending is probably supposed to be symbolic and cleve", "rating": "70"}

He is Anton, a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic Moss (Josh Brolin) after a drug deal goes awry.

{"review": "This is a spoiled brat Hollywood formula version of the classic film NIGHTFALL. It is so parallel to Nightfall that there is no doubt that McCarthy wrote it as a brattish rewrite of the classic film. By brat I mean it is contrived to appease the control freak nature of the immature and spoiled American. I doubt this will fare well in the future, and if anything, it will cause a renewed interest in Nightfall, with Aldo Ray and Brian Keith. Like Nightfall, we have an investigator who feels he is in over his head in a case of money stolen from hoodlums. Like Nightfall, the hero stumbles acro", "rating": "20"}

Out of 20th Century Fox, Big Trouble in Little China is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell, Kim Catrall, Dennis Dun, James Hong & Victor Wong. The adaptation is by W.D. Richter with the screenplay from Gary Goldman & David Z. Weinstein. Dean Cundey photographs and Alan Howarth doubles up with Carpenter for the musical score.

{"review": "Enjoyable enough adventure flick with another charismatic performance from Kurt Russell. The plot certainly felt disjointed at times (and one sequence didn't really advance the plot all that much) but still had a lot of fun. Not one of Carpenter's best nor a standout amongst 1980s movies, however still liked it well enough. 3.5/5", "rating": "70"}

{"review": "Finally got around to watching this after seeing so many memes and clips over the years. Nicolas Cage is at his weirdest for sure but so much fun in his over-the-top performance. Oh, and it's always great seeing Jennifer Beals, especially playing a vampiress (well, kind of). As a whole, not sure if this is brilliantly insane or insanely brilliant, either way I don't think I'll ever forget this one... 3.5/5", "rating": "70"}

{"review": "Robin Williams as a 10 year-old; great cast, but needed a rewrite The Powells in Oakland have a premature baby, whom they name Jack (Robin Williams). The problem is that Jack grows at four times the normal rate and so when he finally is allowed to enter 5th grade at the age of 10 he looks like a 40 year-old man. Diane Lane plays his mother, Bill Cosby his tutor, Jennifer Lopez his teacher and Fran Drescher a single mother who\u2019s attracted to him. \u201cJack\u201d (1996) takes the basic topic of \u201cBig\u201d (1988) and mixes it with the awkwardness of \u201cMilk Money\u201d (1994).

{"review": "Big Dumb Blockbuster Monster Fun Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's The Mummy, he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel The Mummy Returns, a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and exciting things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's Van Helsing, although not as bad. THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies,", "rating": "60"}
{"review": "Absinthe Actioner! Van Helsing is written and directed by Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Shuler Hensley, Elena Anaya, Will Kemp, Kevin J. O'Connor and Alun Armstrong. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Allen Daviau. Famed monster hunter Van Helsing (Jackman) is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula's (Roxburgh) fiendish plan involving the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man. Well it was universally savaged by the pro critics and is considered a flop. Yet whilst understanding those things, it does for a reaso", "rating": "50"}
{"review": "Van Helsing doesn't deserve its early grave and should be resurrected for more fun adventures. Why do people love to hate such an enjoyable movie? Van Helsing falls much more in the adventure genre than horror but still has a little of the edge of a scary movie. Stephen Sommers' influence can be felt throughout with a lot of the same charm that made The Mummy (1999) so great. Van Helsing showcases many of the Universal classic monsters while building a shared universe that should have been explored more than once. With big names like Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale, blockbuster effects,", "rating": "70"}
{"review": "Sorry, but this is just all over the place. A potpourri of myths and legends loosely connected with the famous vampire hunter that just don't gel at all. Doctor Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his monster all vie with Count Dracula for the attention of a really rather lacklustre Hugh Jackman in the title role. Kate Beckinsale sort-of recreates her Underworld role as she becomes his kick-ass sidekick. It's fairly action-packed but the scenes go on for far too long, the script is cheesy, the CGI just isn't great and the attempts at humour don't work well either.", "rating": "60"}

Meanwhile deaths start mounting. Agnes Bruckner, Jonathan Jackson, Laura Ramsey and Rick Cramer head the cast.

I'm willing to suspend my disbelief quite a bit but how is it a gangster assassin doesn't double tap and headshot their target when they have them at point blank? This mafia family soon proves to be one of the dumbest in all of gangster cinema, leaving their loved ones completely open to be followed by Frank Castle, falling for a really terrible manipulation scheme, and how did they find out where Frank Castle's apartment was?

Jon Bernthal might have been the perfect actor to play the Punisher, but Thomas Jane was a close second. Rather than getting all wrapped up in the comic universe, The Punisher (2004) keeps its story contained in a more realistic world and focuses on the transformation of Frank Castle into the Punisher. The cast of this movie is filled with exceptional talent, and the plot is a carefully crafted revenge that unfolds as the film progresses, with an excel", "rating": "80"}

{"review": "A very good stop-motion animation! 'Chicken Run', which I watched a crap tonne when I was little but not for a vast number of years now, is an impressive production given it came out in 2000. Despite a pretty simple feel to the film, it's a very well developed concept. The, admittedly short, run time truly flies by. Of course everything looks, relatively, terrific, but I'm impressed by the pacing which is clean. As for the cast, Julia Sawalha is the definite standout - she's fantastic as Ginger. Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels, as rats Nick and Fetcher, are amusing. Mel Gibson (Ro", "rating": "80"}
{"review": "Ok, there is an huge temptation to riddle this review with puns - but I'm just going to say it's a cracking little family adventure. It's seemingly based on a whole range of classic movies from the Great Escape, Star Trek to Love Story with a score cannibalised from just about any/everything ever written by Messrs. Korngold/Williams & Bernstein all adding to this really super stop-motion animation that Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of..

In the genre of war films, I'm slowly leaning towards the critic. In 'Brothers' each of the characters seems overdrawn to me. No one reveals anything surprising, everyone fulfills their clich\u00e9. The story strictly follows the black and white stereotype of the situation in Afghanistan, completely disregarding being coherent. A Marine has been missing for less than a year and his family is already living 3 chapters after that? If you've seen the trailer,", "rating": "40"}

He is definitely all grown up now. A strong supporting cast of Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis sure didn't hurt. I loved how the cast worked so good together. They were very believable. The movie did a great job of showing us just how crazy and out of control a simple misunderstanding can get. Hopeful Hollywood does force Ben Foster down our throat! Small doses please! NOTE: Alpha Dog has a lot of language in it.", "rating": "Written by J4stringthang on February 6, 2014"}

The story that unfolded before my eyes last night is not one I'm likely to forget anytime soon. The characters, as I understand, are eerily like the real life people depicted, and all of the actors have done a great job terrifying me, surprising me, and making me feel sadder than any other film I can remember in recent history.

{"review": "I suppose a bit better than Apocalypse as it feels a bit more mainstreamed in the plot and action, still not great but some of the fight sequences were okay and has some semblance of interesting ideas and I still like Jovovich in the role even if she's not the strongest actress, but does have some screen presence in this sort of movie. Being so short, you don't get to know Ali Larter's character all that well and felt odd that Jill (Sienna Guillory) and Angie's (Sophie Vavasseur) absences weren't mentioned (that I can remember). 2.5/5", "rating": "50"}
{"review": "Overall : The final horror-focused entry of the franchise with high stakes and some great new characters. The third movie in the Resident Evil franchise and the beginning slide into outright sci-fi action. Most of this entry focuses on survivors attempting to withstand the dangers of a zombie-filled apocalyptic desert. Unfortunately, umbrella\u2019s experiments on Alice have results that sometimes become the focus and begin dragging the franchise further from survival horror. I enjoyed this entry with the addition of Claire Redfield from the games, the return of Carlos Olivera, and the hopele", "rating": "80"}

The story revolves around a 70 year-old man (Tim Roth) in Romania at the outset of WWII who is struck by lightning and miraculously regains his youth, looking like a 40 year-old man. He acquires amazing powers as well, like psycho-kinesis and the ability to read a book by scanning it with his mind.

{"review": "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend. If you like either Jason Biggs or Isla Fisher, then this is a lot of that: a lot of abusive humor to Jason Biggs and a lot of Isla Fisher being quirky but pretty. The premise of being married too soon combined with traumatic experiences is fun, and everyone in the cast is good, but it's only so good. It's nice to see modern day fables though where communication is necessary for happiness.", "rating": "60"}

A man who gets results from a class of students who would almost all rather be somewhere else, and he coaches the girls' basketball team too. Luckily for him, it's one of his pupils, Drey (Shareeka Epps), that discovers him a bit worse for wear in the school toilet and swiftly a friendship develops. It's one of mutual understanding. His life is a mess and she is having to deal with divorced and largely absent parents. Her brother Mike is in jail for dru", "rating": "70"}

Even though I'm a pretty serious music lover, and I've always loved classical music, I didn't know David Helfgott until I saw this film. The musical universe is full of prodigies who reveal talent since childhood. Mozart is perhaps the most famous example of this. However, it is one of those subjects that I feel we tend to overestimate, because you can also find prodigious children in other areas of knowledge, including the H", "rating": "100"}

The scenery is usually drab industrial buildings and rusting dockyards. Kaurism\u00e4ki's 1990 film I HIRED A CONTRACT KILLER moves that formula, developed in his native Helsinki, to London.

Godard borrows the character of Lemmy Caution, a tough FBI agent/secret agent played by Eddie Constantine that had appeared in a number of French B movies, and then Godard drops Caution into a science-fiction film. And yet, this film taking place in a different galaxy far, far away doesn't use any specially created sets or fancy ray guns.

{"review": "Nothing new and only proving that the horror genre in 2008 wasin need of reinvigoration. Jennifer Marsh is a secret service agent, her speciality is crime across the internet. One day she comes across a site that is untraceable, the host of the site conducts painful killings to entertain the watching public. The kicker being that the more people who log on and observe, the quicker the death will be, and, well people being people... There really isn't much to recommend here, outside of a solid performance from Diane Lane as Marsh, and some newer ingenious deaths to woo the gorno crowd, i", "rating": "30"}

It's something that Cleopatra her self shouts at a stunned Mark Antony, but it could quite literally have been shouted by many in Hollywood at 20th Century Fox as their gargantuan epic threatened to sink them. The trials and tribulations surrounding the film are stuff of legend, all of which makes for a film itself, but I will not go over old ground, there's a couple of great documentaries available out there and they are required viewing. They also help to explain somewhat why Cleopatra is not the genre defining classic many hoped it would be. Truth is is that", "rating": "80"}

{"review": "More enjoyable than I would've predicted. I was expecting something more mysterious and thrilling, but 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' manages to entertain nicely - despite a long run time, which I thought was going to hamper it but it didn't. The cast are excellent. I really enjoyed John Cusack's performance and Kevin Spacey plays these sorta roles well. The Lady Chablis is another strong performer, while there are roles for a younger Jude Law, Clint Eastwood - the director - regular Geoffrey Lewis and, though very tiny, an on the brink of stardom James Gandolfini.", "rating": "80"}

Like Se7en, 8MM explores the existence of people who are simply pure evil while the main character wants to know why they are like this. 8MM doesn't provide many answers but it also isn't thematically complex. It follows a standard whodunit plot. While Nicolas Cage gives a solid performance, there are times where he takes us out of the story with his signature freak outs. Joel Schumacher manages to create a gritty tone but he has a rather bland style. Regardless of its flaws, 8MM is still a decent movie. It prefers plot over exploit", "rating": "50"}

{"review": "When Insp. Renko (William Hurt) is called to investigate a rather gruesome find in Moscow's Gorky park, he is soon embroiled in a conspiracy that leaves him unsure whom he can trust. The KGB are involved as are the Americans - and soon it all points to the enigmatic furrier Osborne (Lee Marvin) who has a nifty line in sable hats. What now ensues is a rather dry and procedural mix of thriller and romance with the very presence of Marvin as much of a dead giveaway as you are ever going to get. Marvin brings a certain screen presence, but that just serves to illustrate just how much Hurt is go", "rating": "60"}

The story takes it's time but that all contributes well to the effectiveness of his performance as he must deal with the physical, logistical and increasingly psychological challenges his predicament throws", "rating": "70"}

The movie is full of cringe humor and ridiculous circumstance, it's essentially designed so the characters have a good story to tell later on, and it definitely meets the criteria.

{"review": "Iconic Medieval adventure of the early 90s Released in 1991, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves stars Kevin Costner in the title role. While some have argued that Costner was too humorless and brooding for the part, this is a cinematic myth. There are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than this and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative,", "rating": "70"}

Murder in the First (1995) is a prison/courtroom drama that says its \u201cinspired by true events,\u201d which means it\u2019s NOT a biography of the real Henri Young, but rather uses Young\u2019s basic story as a microcosm for unveiling several of Alcatraz\u2019", "rating": "60"}

Blethyn is great is the venal mother, and Caine equally unscrupulous as they both try to exploit their shy charge.

{"review": "Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend. This is a great survival horror story that really rachets up the tension as the situation progresses. The idea of being hunted in the subway with homeless and rats around is very intriguing for me. Sadly, like most good horror movies, I can't talk about most of it without spoilers. I will say this has some great concepts in it and the over all story structure is very well done with some good twists / surprises in it. It may not be a feel-good love story, but it would be a pretty bad survival horror story if it was.", "rating": "80"}
{"review": "Ok, I confess that the background story and the movie cover attracted my attention. And when I saw Christopher Smith name here I expected something (Severance, Triangle, I thought I had something good to expect) I will be brief and make a full spoiler here: the premise is good, the execution not so much. It is very inconsistent, like a person will be forgotten in a subway station? People don't clean the trains into the night hours? A psycho child from the anti-Blitz tunnels of WWII? No one misses the presence of people (especially workers) in the subway? Come on, that's too much.", "rating": "40"}

{"review": "Entertaining action/comedy Western Released in 2000, Shanghai Noon features Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (the Chinese spelling of John Wayne) who teams up with good bad-guy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures. It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title Shanghai Noon is a comical take on High Noon (aduh).

Madonna isn't bad here either, simply because she's pretending to be Marilyn Monroe, something she'd been wanting to do all of her career to that point.

{"review": "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend. Brittany Snow is great in this, she really does a top notch embodying the terror of her character while still being a strong female lead. There are also other actors in this. Honestly, Idris Elba and Johnathon Schaech carry a fair portion of the movie. It does do something fun when it follows the villain as if he is one of the protagonists. It helps that some of the teens are awful, you can almost root for him as he progresses. It is hard to talk about without spoilers, but I can safely say that they manage to both follow hi", "rating": "70"}

{"review": "For England, for home, and for the prize! Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is directed by Peter Weir, it stars Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin. It is spliced from various novels in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian. The film takes place during 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars and finds Captain Jack Aubrey and the crew of British frigate HMS Surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the French privateer Acheron. But the Acheron (The Phantom as the crew of the Surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her Ca", "rating": "90"}
{"review": "This is a rousing sea yarn with great camera work, but it also shows comraderie and relationships in a realistic way on board a British fighting ship. As happens sometimes but not always, I enjoyed this movie more than I liked the book it was based upon. O'Brian has written a lot of great sea tales, but this one confused me. I felt like checking to see if the pages were in the correct order. The story seems simplified in this adaptation. (Some may say that is not a good thing!) The first several minutes of the film move the viewer around the ship, and I felt like It was a realistic repres", "rating": "100"}
{"review": "I enjoyed 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'. The early scenes are surprisingly (given the relatively close release dates) similar to fellow 2003 release 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl', with a hidden enemy ship spotted amid foggy conditions and then one person spots unexpected cannon fire and tells others to duck... there are even main characters named Jack (lead!) and Will! With those amusing (to me, given that POTC is my favourite film) connections noted, the film goes on, of course, to do it's own thing and I'd say it comes out", "rating": "80"}
{"review": "What you have here is Crowe still thinking that he's the greatest actor that ever lived. That all takes away the fun of a movie that had the potential to be a high seas epic like, say, Captain Blood. Peter Weir lets Crowe go crazy and you can almost taste the ego dripping out of the pours of every seen, so much so that he doesn't allow Paul Bettany to shine and he's a good actor in his own right, as is James D'Arcy and again, Crowe seems to want to hog all the acting glory there too.

{"review": "This has shades of Horatio Hornblower to it, but is much grittier. Russell Crowe delivers a strong, convincing, portrayal of the doughty captain Aubrey, in command of HMS Surprise and charged with tracking down a French privateer that is raiding the vital British whaling fleet during the Napoleonic wars. Coming up against an equally courageous and skilful French captain and engaging in a lethal game of cat and mouse, he must outmanoeuvre this cunning foe before he and his crew end up in Davy Jones' Locker.

When Annie Clarke's beloved husband succumbs to leukaemia, her best friend Chris comes up with a unique idea for raising funds for the hospital that cared for the dearly departed John. They, and fellow members of the Knapely Womens Institute, will pose in some strategically nude pictures and sell them as a calendar! Based on a true story, and following on from the roaring success of 1997s The Full Monty, it was a story just begging to be adapted for the big screen.

{"review": "Another one of those movies I watched back when it came out and recently watched again. Like the women who pose for the calendar, the movie has aged well. My wife and I watch a lot of British tv (for Americans) so we have seen the actresses in many other excellent performances. Calendar a Girls reminds me of another great movie, (Waking) Ned Devine. There is humor, a feel good plot, and a fine ensemble cast. There are a perhaps a couple of more serious subplots in this film, such as Alderton\u2019s character\u2019s illness that gives birth to the calendar fundraiser. The movie is of course based on", "rating": "90"}
{"review": "Another one of those movies I watched decades ago and recently revisited. I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time. It reminds me of Waking Ned Devine in a way. It contains witty and realistic dialogue and a good percentage of the actors are older. There is a bit more drama in Calendar Girls, but it never submerges into melodrama. I am glad I watched it a second time. It has aged well and is a classic feel old movie.", "rating": "90"}

{"review": "Enjoyed it. 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' does nothing all that extraordinary but produces a fun time nevertheless. Great cast, fast paced plot and entertaining action. The ending slightly underwhelms, but I still found myself satisfied with it. The special effects are good, it's only The Nautilus that looks less than so. Sean Connery does carry the film as Quatermain, he's terrific throughout - really enjoyed the way his character carries himself. I liked Tony Curran's Skinner too.

Always like the ideas of alternate history and while this doesn't quite change history in the end (and shouldn't given it was Pearl Harbor, not to mention when this movie was released, survivors were only in their early/mid 60s), still was a good time.

The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version. The Thin", "rating": "60"}
